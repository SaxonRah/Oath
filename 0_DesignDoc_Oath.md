# Idea
late 90's early 00's 3d rpg based around gathering renown (combat renown and quest renown) and wealth (gold and materials).

The goal is to create a kingdom / making a city. Everything is based around wealth and how well renown you are.
killing monsters can gives you materials, loot and or gold, plus raises combat renown.
questing gives you materials, loot, and or gold, plus raises questing renown. 

You can gain followers via payment in gold, materials or high enough combat/questing renown.
these followers will move in to your city and bring desirable traits like city renown, gold, materials, loot into your city and or desirable professions like blacksmithing, or farming, or animal breeding. 
you gain kingdom reputation which allows for more followers/city abilities/number of buildings, etc.

this creates a feedback which you requires all these things and playing the game gives you resources which allows you to spend it on things and people to draw more people and things into your kingdom.

the game will be largely procedurally generated.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Late 90s/early 00s 3D RPG feel, with a satisfying progression system centered around reputation and wealth. 

### Character Creation
    - Choose from classic archetypes (Warrior, Rogue, Mage, Ranger, Custom)
    - Each class offers different bonuses to Combat or Quest Renown acquisition
    - Select a starting "vision" for your future kingdom (Military Stronghold, Trade Hub, Magical Haven, etc.)

### The World
    - Low-poly 3D open world with distinct biomes (forests, mountains, deserts, swamps)
    - Procedurally generated landscapes with hand-crafted landmarks
    - Day/night cycle affecting monster spawns and NPC schedules
    - Weather system impacting travel and certain gathering activities

### Progression Systems

    3. **Seasonal Festivals**: Hold regular events to boost kingdom morale and attract special followers
    4. **Expeditions**: Send followers on automated quests for resources while you focus on other activities
    5. **Legacy System**: When your character reaches maximum level, you can "retire" them as a special NPC in your kingdom and start with their descendant
