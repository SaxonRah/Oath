# Comprehensive Religion and Deity System for Oath

Religion and Deity System:
- Multiple deities with favor tracking
- Temple quests and prayer benefits
- Divine intervention based on devotion
- Religious conflicts between pantheons
- Sacred days with special events

---

1. **Pantheon of Deities**: Nine distinct deities with personalities, domains, and favor systems
2. **Favor and Devotion**: Tracking a player's standing with each deity
3. **Temples**: Sacred locations where players can interact with each deity
4. **Rituals**: Special ceremonies that can be performed to gain favor and blessings
5. **Prayers**: Direct communication with deities for various benefits
6. **Blessings**: Divine effects that benefit the player
7. **Holy Days**: Special calendar days associated with each deity
8. **Religious Quests**: Special missions to serve the gods
9. **Temple Services**: Healing, curse removal, and divination
10. **Offerings**: Items that can be sacrificed for favor

The implementation follows your tree automata pattern with clear state transitions and flexible node hierarchy. It extends the GameContext to include religious information and provides specialized node types like DeityNode, TempleNode, RitualNode, PrayerNode, and BlessingNode.

The demo execution shows a player interacting with the Sun God, visiting a temple, making offerings, performing rituals, and praying for blessings.

This system would add significant depth to Oath by creating meaningful choices based on which deity (or deities) the player aligns with, and providing mechanical benefits through the religious favor system.
