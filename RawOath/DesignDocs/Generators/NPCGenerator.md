# NPC Generation System Design

The NPC Generation System will create dynamic, diverse, and contextually appropriate non-player characters for role-playing games, using JSON as a configuration and template mechanism.

## Core Components

### 1. NPC Core Structure
```markdown
- Basic Attributes
  - Name
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Race/Species
  - Occupation
  - Social Class

- Physical Characteristics
  - Height
  - Build
  - Hair Color/Style
  - Eye Color
  - Distinguishing Features

- Personality
  - Personality Traits
  - Motivations
  - Fears
  - Desires
  - Moral Alignment

- Background
  - Origin Location
  - Family History
  - Education
  - Professional History
  - Significant Life Events

- Social Connections
  - Relationships
  - Faction Affiliations
  - Allies
  - Enemies

- Skills and Capabilities
  - Primary Skills
  - Secondary Skills
  - Combat Abilities
  - Unique Talents

- Inventory and Possessions
  - Clothing and Appearance
  - Weapons
  - Personal Items
  - Wealth

- Dialogue and Interaction
  - Communication Style
  - Typical Phrases
  - Quest/Interaction Hooks
```

## Generation Mechanisms

### 2. JSON Templates
- Base Templates
  - General Character Archetypes
  - Occupation-specific Templates
  - Cultural/Regional Templates
  - Faction-specific Templates

### 3. Generation Rules
- Weighted Probability Systems
- Contextual Generation
- Relationship and Faction Compatibility
- Skill and Background Coherence

### 4. Generation Stages
1. Core Attribute Generation
2. Background Randomization
3. Skill and Capability Assignment
4. Social Connection Mapping
5. Inventory and Possession Assignment
6. Dialogue Profile Creation

## JSON Configuration Examples

### Basic Character Template
```json
{
  "template_name": "Tavern Keeper",
  "base_attributes": {
    "age_range": {"min": 30, "max": 55},
    "gender_probability": {"male": 0.6, "female": 0.4},
    "race_probabilities": {
      "human": 0.7,
      "half-elf": 0.2,
      "dwarf": 0.1
    }
  },
  "physical_traits": {
    "height_range": {"min": 160, "max": 190},
    "build_types": ["stocky", "average", "lean"],
    "hair_colors": ["brown", "gray", "salt-and-pepper"],
    "distinguishing_features": {
      "probability": 0.3,
      "types": ["scar", "tattoo", "birthmark"]
    }
  },
  "personality": {
    "traits": [
      "jovial", "observant", "protective", "wise", "gruff"
    ],
    "moral_alignments": [
      "neutral good", "lawful neutral", "true neutral"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Skill and Background Template
```json
{
  "occupation_skills": {
    "tavern_keeper": {
      "primary_skills": {
        "persuasion": {"base": 3, "max": 7},
        "cooking": {"base": 2, "max": 8},
        "brewing": {"base": 4, "max": 9}
      },
      "secondary_skills": {
        "local_history": {"base": 1, "max": 5},
        "conflict_resolution": {"base": 2, "max": 6}
      }
    }
  },
  "background_events": {
    "origin_locations": ["small town", "city", "rural village"],
    "life_events": {
      "probability": 0.7,
      "types": [
        "inherited business",
        "survived hardship",
        "traveled extensively",
        "trained by mentor"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
