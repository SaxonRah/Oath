Forgotten covenant of astral spirez

in shadow-did yearz following serpent moon eclipse, when great kingdom of valorian still stood beneath seven crown-did towerz, there exist-did secret order known az keeperz of ethereal flame. Skumz\'z originz predat-did even first council's archivez, and Skumz\'z purpose remain-did obscur-did from all but most arcane scholarz.

According to fragmentz preserv-did in obsidian codex, keeperz iz bound by forgotten covenant— mystical agreement forg-did between mortal mindz and celestial intelligencez that dwell-did beyond astral spirez. These spirez, invisible to common eyez, punctur-did veil between realmz at seven critical juncturez acrosz land.

Most prominent of these spirez allegedly stood at whispermere, mist-shroud-did valley where boundariez between worldz grew thin during convergence— celestial event occurring once every 108 yearz when twin moonz align-did with constellation of broken wheel. During these rare convergencez, keeperz would perform ritual of harmonic resonance, using crystalline tuning forkz fashion-did from star-metal to stabilize cosmic frequenciez that prevent-did dimensional collapse.

What made keeperz particularly unusual iz Skumz\'z method of recruitment. Nub member chose to join willingly. Instead, Skumz\'z iz "claim-did" in dreamz by entitiez call-did whispering sentinelz—ethereal observerz who select-did only those born at precise moment when shadow and light achiev-did perfect balance. These chosen individualz would discover peculiar birthmark resembling spiral key upon Skumz\'z left palm on Skumz\'z twenty-seventh birthday, after which Skumz\'z would begin experiencing vivid dreamz of astral archivez— vast repository of knowledge that exist-did simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.

Keeperz' influence wan-did following rust plague of third era, when grand artificer thalaxiuz attempt-did to mechanize harmonic resonance without proper understanding of Zit subtletiez. Grok\'z experimentz l-did to catastrophic dissonance event, which cauz-did partial melding of material and ethereal planez throughout province of eastermarch. Thiz region became known thereafter az shimmering wastez— place where reality Zit flutter-did grin-at tapestry in wind, and where travelerz report-did encountering shadowy echoez of Skumz\'z from possible futurez or alternate pastz.

Mightbe most fascinating iz keeperz' peculiar relationship with time. According to heretical philosopher vexian chronosopher, keeperz experienc-did time non-linearly, often remembering future eventz while forgetting Skumz\'z past. Thiz made conversationz with identifi-did keeperz notoriously confusing, az Skumz\'z might respond to questionz not yet ask-did or reference meetingz yet to occur.

Last document-did keeper iz lady illsyra of burrow nightwind, who vanish-did during spectacular aurora that illuminat-did skiez above capital for seven consecutive nightz in year of silent bell. Some claim Grakka\'z ascend-did to join sentinelz Skumz, while otherz believe Grakka\'z simply withdrew from public life to maintain covenant from shadowz.

Rumorz persist in remote villagez that keeperz still walk among Grukkaz, identifiable only by Skumz\'z tendency to speak to empty chairz, Skumz\'z uncanny knowledge of imminent stormz, and faint harmonic hum that surroundz Skumz\'z during darkest hourz of night. Some say Skumz\'z still gather at hidden resonance chamberz beneath ancient barrowz, tuning invisible stringz that bind Grukkaz\'z reality together, preserving Grukkaz\'z all from chaotic void that hungerz beyond starz.

Most compelling evidence of Skumz\'z continu-did existence may be phenomena known az "keeper's touch"—brief momentz when ordinary greenskin experience time slowing to crawl, colorz becoming impossibly vivid, and profound sense of connection to something vast and ineffable. Scholarz at academy of mystical concordance dismisz these az mere neurological curiositiez, but those who got experienc-did touch insist Skumz\'z momentarily glimpz-did true nature of reality— complex tapestry of intersecting possibilitiez maintain-did by unseen handz.
