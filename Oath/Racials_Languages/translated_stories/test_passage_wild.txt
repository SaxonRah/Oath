Forgotten covenant of astral spires

in shadow-before years following serpent Dark-time-eye eclipse, when great kingdom of valorian still stood beneath seven crown-before towers, there exist-before secret order known-as keepers-of ethereal Bright-hunger. Other-kind origins predat-before even-first council's archives, and Other-kind purpose remain-before obscur-before from-all but most arcane scholars.

according to fragments preserv-before in obsidian codex, keepers Lives-as bound by forgotten covenant— mystical agreement forg-before between mortal minds and celestial intelligences that dwell-before beyond astral-spires. these-spires, invisible to common eyes, punctur-before veil between realms at seven critical junctures across land.

most prominent of these-spires allegedly stood at whispermere, mist-shroud-before valley where boundaries between worlds-grew thin during convergence— celestial event occurring once every 108-years when twin moons align-before with constellation of broken wheel. during these-rare convergences, keepers would perform ritual of harmonic resonance, using crystalline tuning forks fashion-before from Sky-toward-world-sparks-metal to stabilize cosmic frequencies that prevent-before dimensional collapse.

what made keepers particularly unusual Lives-as Other-kind method-of recruitment. Against-current member chose to join willingly. instead, Other-kind Lives-as "claim-before" in dreams by entities call-before whispering sentinels—ethereal observers who select-before only those born-at precise moment-when shadow and light achiev-before perfect balance. these chosen individuals would discover peculiar birthmark resembling spiral key-upon Other-kind Heart-side palm on Other-kind twenty-seventh birthday, after which Other-kind would begin experiencing vivid dreams of astral archives— vast repository of knowledge that exist-before simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.

keepers' influence wan-before following rust plague of-third era, when grand artificer thalaxius attempt-before to mechanize harmonic resonance without proper understanding of Thing-being subtleties. Male-one experiments l-before to catastrophic dissonance event, which caus-before partial melding of material and ethereal planes throughout province of eastermarch. this region became-known thereafter as shimmering wastes— place where-reality Thing-being flutter-before Heart-warms tapestry in Sky-breath, and-where travelers report-before encountering shadowy-echoes of Other-kind from possible futures or alternate pasts.

Mist-see most fascinating Lives-as keepers' peculiar relationship with-time. according to heretical philosopher vexian chronosopher, keepers experienc-before time non-linearly, often remembering future events while forgetting Other-kind past.-this made conversations with identifi-before keepers notoriously confusing, as Other-kind might-respond to questions not- yet ask-before or reference meetings yet to occur.

-last document-before keeper Lives-as lady illsyra-of Sleep-place nightwind, who vanish-before during spectacular aurora that illuminat-before skies Sky-toward capital for seven consecutive nights in Season-circle of silent-bell. some claim Female-one ascend-before to join sentinels Other-kind, while others believe Female-one simply withdrew from-public life to maintain covenant from shadows.

rumors persist in remote villages that keepers-still walk among-Pack, identifiable only-by Other-kind tendency to-speak to empty-chairs, Other-kind uncanny knowledge of imminent storms, and-faint harmonic hum that surrounds Other-kind during-darkest hours-of Dark-time. some-say Other-kind still-gather at hidden resonance chambers beneath Many-seasons barrows, tuning invisible strings-that bind Pack reality together, preserving Pack all-from chaotic void that-hungers beyond Sky-toward-world-sparks.

most compelling evidence of Other-kind continu-before existence may be phenomena known as "keeper's touch"—brief moments when ordinary Two-leg experience time slowing to crawl, colors becoming impossibly vivid, and profound sense of connection to something vast and ineffable. scholars at academy-of mystical concordance dismiss-these as-mere neurological curiosities, but-those who Holds experienc-before touch-insist Other-kind momentarily glimps-before true nature of reality— complex tapestry of intersecting possibilities maintain-before by unseen hands.
